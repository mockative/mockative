[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.mockative/mockative)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.mockative/mockative)

Mocking for Kotlin/Native and Kotlin Multiplatform using the Kotlin Symbol Processing API ([KSP]).
Notable features include:

- Concise, non-intrusive, type-safe API
- Mocking of classes and interfaces
- Supports both [values](#stubbing-using-values) and [matchers](#stubbing-using-matchers) when
  during
  stubbing [verification](#verification)
- Supports [implicit stubbing](#implicit-stubbing-of-functions-returning-unit) of functions
  returning `Unit`

## Installation for Multiplatform projects

> ❗️Mockative 2 introduces a new API that should feel familiar to the Kotlin/JVM developers coming
> from [MockK](https://mockk.io/) and Java developers coming from
> [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/).
>
> Please see [Migrating to Mockative 2](wiki/MIGRATING-TO-2.md) for a migration guide.

Mockative uses [KSP] to generate mock classes, and as such, it requires adding the
KSP plugin in addition to adding the runtime library and symbol processor dependencies.

**build.gradle.kts**

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonTest by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.mockative:mockative:2.1.0")
            }
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    configurations
        .filter { it.name.startsWith("ksp") && it.name.contains("Test") }
        .forEach {
            add(it.name, "io.mockative:mockative-processor:2.1.0")
        }
}
```

> 💡 I have plans to introduce a Gradle plugin that will take care of most of the configuration specified above and below

## Gradle configuration for mocking classes
To utilize Mockative effectively in your Kotlin project, it's essential to configure your Gradle build script to open classes for mocking. Mockative requires classes to be open for subclassing, as Kotlin classes are final by default. This is achieved using the Kotlin `all-open` compiler plugin.

### Step 1: Apply the Kotlin All-Open Plugin
First, ensure that your project applies the Kotlin `all-open` plugin. Add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") // or kotlin("multiplatform") as applicable
    kotlin("plugin.allopen")
}
```

### Step 2: Configure `allOpen` Annotation
Create an annotation in your project that will be used to mark classes that should be open, and thus mockable by Mockative.
Consider making an annotation class:
```kotlin
package io.github

@Retention(AnnotationRetention.SOURCE)
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class Mockable
```

Next, configure the `allOpen` plugin to recognize your custom `@Mockable` annotation. This step makes all classes annotated with `@Mockable` open during test, thus allowing Mockative to generate a mock implementation for each of them. An example configuration is shown below:

```kotlin
val taskIsRunningTest = gradle.startParameter.taskNames.any {
  it == "check" || it.startsWith("test") || it.contains("Test")
}
if (taskIsRunningTest) {
  allOpen {
    annotation("io.github.Mockable")
  }
}
```

This configuration should be placed outside of and after the `plugins` block.

### Using your annotation to mock classes

To mock a class with Mockative, annotate the class with your annotation (interfaces are always open). This annotation indicates to Mockative (and the Kotlin compiler, with the above configuration) that the class should be open for subclassing and available for mocking during tests.

```kotlin
import io.github.Mockable

@Mockable
class MyService {
    // ...
}
```

### Global Mocking

If you prefer to make all classes in your project open (and thus also mockable by Mockative) without annotating them individually, you can adjust the `allOpen` configuration to apply to all classes. However, use this approach with caution, as it may have unintended side effects by making all your classes non-final.

```kotlin
allOpen {
    annotation("kotlin.Metadata")
}
```

## Testing with Mockative

To mock a given method on an interface or a class, annotate a property holding the interface- or class type with the
`@Mock` annotation, and assign it to the result of a call to the `<T> mock(KClass<T>)` function:

```kotlin
class GitHubServiceTests {
    @Mock
    val api = mock(classOf<GitHubAPI>())
}
```

Then, to stub a function or property on the mock there is a couple of options:

### Stubbing using values

To begin stubbing a function you may simply pass the values to the function call inside a block 
passed to the `every`/`justRun` or `coEvery`/`coJustRun` (when stubbing a `suspend` function) functions:

```kotlin
// Stub a blocking function
every { githubApi.getRepository("mockative/mockative") } invokes { response }

// Stub a `suspend` function (notice the use of `coEvery`)
coEvery { repositoryMapper.mapResponseToRepository(response) } invokes { repository }

// Stub a property getter
every { repository.maintainer } returns "Nillerr"

// Stub a property setter (functions returning `Unit` are stubbed by default)
justRun { repository.stars = repository.stars + 1 }
```

### Stubbing using matchers

Sometimes when stubbing a function we're faced with difficulties providing a specified value for 
one or more of the parameters of our expectation. In such cases we can use the matcher API to 
specify the values our stub accepts:

```kotlin
// Assuming we want to stub the function in this S3Client:
interface S3Client {
  suspend fun <T> getObject(input: GetObjectRequest, block: suspend (GetObjectResponse) -> T): T
}

// Providing a value for the `block` parameter is difficult, so we can use the `any()` matcher to
// specify that this expectation will match any value passed to that parameter. When we use one 
// matcher, we must use matchers for every parameter, and as such we must use the `eq(value)` 
// matcher to specify that we're expecting a specific request.
coEvery { s3Client.getObject<File>(eq(request), any()) }
  .returnsMany(expected)
```

Also note how we're explicitly specifying the type parameter. We could do the same by explicitly 
specifying it in the call to `any()` like this:

```kotlin
any<suspend (GetObjectResponse) -> File>()
```

But that would be significantly more verbose that the alternative.

### Stubbing using functions

You may want to provide a function as an argument to another function, where you would like to be 
able to record invocations on that function. To do that, Mockative includes the interfaces `Fun[N]` 
and `CoFun[N]` (for `suspend` functions), each declaring a single function `invoke` that you can 
pass as a mock to other functions in order to stub and verify invocations on it:

```kotlin
// Declare the mock function as a property in your test class
@Mock
val block = mock(classOf<Fun1<GetObjectResponse, File>>())

// Stub the mock function
every { block.invoke(response) } returns file

// Call something that calls the mock function
s3Client.getObject(request, block::invoke)

// Verify the call to the mock function
verify { block.invoke(response) }
```

### Stubbing implementations

The following functions are available to provide a stub implementation for every expectation:

| Function                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `invokes(block: (args: Array<Any?>) -> R)`            | Invokes the specified block. The arguments passed to the block are the arguments passed to the invocation.                                                                                                                       |
| `invokes(block: () -> R)`                             | Invokes the specified block.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `invokesMany(vararg block: (args: Array<Any?>) -> R)` | Invokes the specified blocks in sequence. The arguments passed to the block are the arguments passed to the invocation. Once the last block in the sequence has been invoked, this stubbing will no longer match any invocation. |
| `invokesMany(vararg blocks: () -> R)`                 | Invokes the specified block. Once the last block in the sequence has been invoked, this stubbing will no longer match any invocation.                                                                                            |
| `returns(value: R)`                                   | Returns the specified value.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `returnsMany(vararg value: R)`                        | Returns the specified values in sequence. Once the last value in the sequence has been returned, this stubbing will no longer match any invocation.                                                                              |
| `throws(throwable: Throwable)`                        | Throws the specified exception.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `throwsMany(throwable: Throwable)`                    | Throws the specified exceptions in sequence. Once the last exception in the sequence has been thrown, this stubbing will no longer match any invocation.                                                                         |

### Implicit stubbing of functions returning Unit

Mockative automatically stubs functions returning `Unit`, based on the idea that such functions are
typically used for verification rather than stubbing, and stubbing them could thus be considered
boilerplate, while they are trivially automatically stubbed.

> ❕This behaviour is different from Mockative 1.X, where stubbing `Unit` returning
> functions was opt-in, where-as it is not opt-out.

You can opt out of this behaviour on the project level through your **build.gradle.kts** file:

**build.gradle.kts**

```kotlin
ksp {
    arg("mockative.stubsUnitByDefault", "false")
}
```

Alternatively, you can opt out (or opt-in if you've opted out on the project level), using the
`configure(mock, block)` function either inline:

```kotlin
@Mock
val api = configure(mock(classOf<GitHubAPI>())) { stubsUnitByDefault = false }
```

Or as needed:

```kotlin
@Mock
val api = mock(classOf<GitHubAPI>())

@Test
fun test() {
    configure(api) { stubsUnitByDefault = false }
}
```

The configuration is stored on the mock instance. It must be configured before receiving any
invocations.

## Generic Types

When mocking a generic type use the `<T> classOf(): KClass<T>` function to retain the type
arguments when passed to the `<T> mock(KClass<T>)` function. You can use the `classOf` function
regardless of whether you're mocking a generic or non-generic type.

```kotlin
class GenericTypeTest {
    @Mock
    val list = mock(classOf<List<String>>())
}
```

## Verification

Verification of invocations on mocks is supported through the `verify` and `coVerify` functions 
using either values or matchers as per the stubbing (`every`) API:

### Verification using values

```kotlin
// Verify a `suspend` function (notice the use of `coVerify`)
coVerify(exactly = never) { githubApi.getRepository("mockative/mockative") }

// Verify a blocking function
verify(atLeast = 1) { repositoryMapper.mapResponseToRepository(response) }

// Verify a property getter
verify(atLeast = once, atMost = 6) { repository.maintainer }

// Verify a property setter
verify(exactly = 1) { repository.stars = repository.stars + 1 }
```

### Verification using matchers

```kotlin
// Verify a suspend function (notice the use of `coVerify`)
coVerify(exactly = once) { s3Client.getObject<File>(eq(request), any()) }
```

## Validation

In addition to verification of expectations there's also validation of the use of expectations, 
which, if not used, can lead to both "under verification" and "over mocking" resulting in 
inaccurate tests. To handle such cases Mockative provides 2 functions you can use on your mocks, 
usually in the `@AfterEach` function of your tests:

```kotlin
@AfterEach
fun afterEach() {
  // Verifies that all expectations were verified through a call to `verify`.
  confirmVerified(githubApi)
  
  // Verifies that the mock has no expectations that weren't invoked at least once.
  checkUnnecessaryStub(s3Client)
}
```
